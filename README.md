# react-customhook-form

This is a custom hook, created so that you can use it in multiple forms, no matter if it's a register form or login form, the hook is generic.
You can also choose your own warning messages, design, etc, i focused mainly on the functionality here and not the design.

If you want to try it out:

# 1 yarn install
# 2 yarn start
